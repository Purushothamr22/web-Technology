<p><i><u><b> Bluetooth</b> is a short-range wireless technology standard that is used for exchanging data between fixed and
        mobile devices over short distances and building personal area networks (PANs).</u> In the most widely used mode,
        transmission power is limited to 2.5 milliwatts, giving it a very short range of up to 10 metres (33 ft). It
        employs UHF radio waves in the ISM bands,<mark>from 2.402 GHz to 2.48 GHz.</mark> [3] It is mainly used as an
        alternative to
        wired connections to exchange files between nearby portable devices and connect cell phones and music players
        with wireless headphones.

       <b> Bluetooth is managed by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG), which has more than 35,000 member companies
        in the areas of telecommunication, computing, networking, and consumer electronics. The IEEE standardized
        Bluetooth as IEEE 802.15.1 but no longer maintains the standard.</b> The Bluetooth SIG oversees the development of
        the specification, manages the qualification program, and protects the trademarks.[4] A manufacturer must meet
        Bluetooth SIG standards to market it as a Bluetooth device</i></p>
